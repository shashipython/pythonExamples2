'''
Instead of using the normal statements to access attributes, you can use following functions:

    The getattr(obj, name[, default]) : to access the attribute of object.

    The hasattr(obj,name) : to check if an attribute exists or not.

    The setattr(obj,name,value) : to set an attribute. If attribute does not exist, then it would be created.

    The delattr(obj, name) : to delete an attribute.

hasattr(emp1, 'age')    # Returns true if 'age' attribute exists
getattr(emp1, 'age')    # Returns value of 'age' attribute
setattr(emp1, 'age', 8) # Set attribute 'age' at 8
delattr(empl, 'age')    # Delete attribute 'age'
