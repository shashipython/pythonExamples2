Class: A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.

Class variable: A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables aren't used as frequently as instance variables are.

Data member: A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.

Function overloading: The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects (arguments) involved.

Instance variable: A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.

Inheritance : The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.

Instance: An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.

Instantiation : The creation of an instance of a class.

Method : A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.

Object : A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.

Operator overloading: The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator




1	__init__ ( self [,args...] )
Constructor (with any optional arguments)
Sample Call : obj = className(args)
2	__del__( self )
Destructor, deletes an object
Sample Call : del obj
3	__repr__( self )
Evaluatable string representation
Sample Call : repr(obj)
4	__str__( self )
Printable string representation
Sample Call : str(obj)
5	__cmp__ ( self, x )
Object comparison
Sample Call : cmp(obj, x)
